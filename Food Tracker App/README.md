# Food-Tracker-Application-Project

**There are dozens of food, exercise, calorie, grocery, and lifestyle trackers in the world of applications. You have just been tasked by your team to help design and build a new type of food tracker, which will "revolutionize" this facet of the mobile app industry. Since you are in the budding phase of this apps' development, you will need to slate it out in a rough sketch-up, then write your code to show the BASIC design and function of the application. Remember, you are not building the whole app, you are just coming up with a skeleton for the app for use when pitching the idea to your investors.**

*Follow the instructions below to design and build your version of the Food Tracker*

  1. Fork this repository and name it "Food Tracker App."
  2. Clone it down to your local machine and ensure that you have correctly mapped the path of your directory.
  3. Food Tracker - Build an app that tracks and manages food you purchase.
  4. Utilize HTML, CSS, Javasript, JQuery and DOM Manipulation to build your source code.
  5. Make use of best-practices (commenting, pushing, file-naming, etc.) 

  **Requirements**
  
    Allow the user to enter food names, a description, date of purchase, and a shelf life or expiration date.
    Have entered food show in a table on the page
    For food that is expiring in the next three days, highlight the row in red.
    
  **Above and beyond**
  
    Use browser cookies or HTML5 browser storage to make the data persistent (reappear when they come back to the page).

*Do not submit a pull request until you are finished with your source code. Once you have done this, I will assume that you are ready for me begin grading your assignment.*
